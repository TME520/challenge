# Challenge report
## Overall impression
A very interesting challenge, I loved it:
- I learned new things about Kubernetes (autoscaling, general principles),
- I discovered minikube which is a lovely tool.
## The good
- It works,
- It's fairly clean,
- It's well documented,
- It fails nicely.
## The bad
- Could definitely be polished some more, especially around errors management (failed deployment, failed upgrade),
- I wish I could spend more time on this, containers are the present and the future.
## Considerations for the future
I will definitely increase my usage of containers and put that technology to good use with my Cozmo Office Mate project (private repo on my GitHub -> https://github.com/TME520).
